The next steps for the project would be:
    1. finish validating all the moves and make sure the game is running smoothly
    2. config files for returning the errors
    3. implement the bot
    4. add a server on top of it
        Endpoints for this would be:

            POST /schess/validate-move
                payload:
                        a. board
                        b. move
                response:
                    OK         => updated board
                    BadRequest => message what went wrong

            POST /schess/bot-move
                paylod:
                        a. board
                response:
                    OK         => updated board

            POST /schess/board
                payload:
                    players
                response:
                    initial board
    5. develop a frontend which uses the server correctly
