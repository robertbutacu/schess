There are several layers when it comes to the bot:
    1. the difficulty layer       - depending on that ( easy, medium, hard ) - the AI generates X, Y or Z levels of the moves.
        It is an important optimisation to also memorise the chosen path so it will not be computed again.
    2. the state-generation layer - the layer where N levels of moves are generated
    3. the scoring system layer   - where all the moves from the previous layer are scored based on some sensible factors
        Ideally, the AI should be influenced by future moves as well in scoring a move:
            For example, having the opponent in an unfortunate position or even the AI in a favorable one should up the score.
    4. the min-max algorithm      - most likely what is going to be used, where a move is chosen from all the scores

    Since complexity is of crucial importance, the 2nd and 3rd layers should be intertwined so they are computed at the same time.
    Aka, in a Future[] - or maybe use Monix's Task or some other Future structure.
